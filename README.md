Compiler design basics are fundamental to various areas within computer science and software development. Their applications extend beyond just building traditional compilers.This is the most direct application. The principles of lexical analysis, parsing, semantic analysis, intermediate code generation, optimization, and code generation are directly applied to build compilers (like for C, C++, Rust) and interpreters (like for Python, JavaScript).
